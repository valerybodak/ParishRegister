# Parish register

A parish register in an ecclesiastical parish is a handwritten volume, normally kept in the parish church in which certain details of religious ceremonies marking major events such as baptisms (together with the dates and names of the parents), marriages (with the names of the partners), children, and burials (that had taken place within the parish) are recorded.

Parish registers are unique in that no other collection recorded the entire population over such a long period â€“ including the baptisms, marriages and burials of men, women and children from all walks of life, century after century.

By using parish registers it's possible to trace your ancestors back as far as the 1600s.
